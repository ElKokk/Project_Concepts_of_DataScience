    "### Definition of a Ternary Search Tree <a name=\"Definition_of_a_Ternary_Search_Tree\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "A Ternary Search Tree (TST) is a special type of trie data structure where nodes are arranged in a manner similar to a binary search tree, but with up to three children rather than the binary tree's limit of two. Each node has a character, three links and a value. The three links correspond to keys whose current characters are less than, equal to, or greater than the node’s character ([Sedgewick and Wayne, 2011](#references)). Like other prefix trees, a TST can be used to store strings over an alphabet. It is efficient for queries like \"Give me all strings with the prefix 'abc'\", which is particularly useful in applications like providing word suggestions in a text editor."

    "### Brief description of the algorithm <a name=\"Brief_description_of_the_algorithm\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "To search and insert we first compare the first character in the key with the character at the root. If it less, we take the left link; if it is greater, we take the right link; and if it is equal, we take the middle link and move to the next search key character. In each case, we apply the algorithm recursively. We terminate with a search miss if we encounter a null link or if the node where the search ends has a null value, and we terminate with a search hit if the node where the search ends has a non-null value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This representation was initially provided by Jon Bentley and Sedgewick. A ternary search tree takes the advantages of binary search trees and tries. That means it combines the memory efficiency of BSTs and the time efficiency of tries. ([Karumanchi, N., 2016](#references))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To insert a new key, we search, then add new nodes for the characters in the tail of the key. We use the characters of the key to guide us down the TST until reaching the last character of the key or a null link. At this point, one of the following two conditions holds:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) We encountered a null link before reaching the last character of the key. In this\n",
    "case, there is no trie node corresponding to the last character in the key, so we\n",

    "and set the value in the last one to the value to be associated with the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) We encountered the last character of the key before reaching a null link. In this\n",
    "case, we set that node’s value to the value to be associated with the key (whether\n",
    "or not that value is null), as usual with our associative array convention."

    "#### Time complexity of traversing the trie<a name=\"Trie_complexity\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically about traversing the trie structure, in a TST, each node contains a character of a key. As we described previously when we're searching for a key, we start at the root of the TST and compare the first character of our key with the character at the current node. If they match, we move to the middle child and proceed to the next character in our key or we move to the left/right child. This process continues until we've either found our key or reached a null link.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of this traversal is proportional to the length of the key, L, because we need to make a comparison for each character in the key. This is represented as O(L), where O is the notation for time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the time complexity O(L) represents the number of character comparisons in the key itself, it doesn't account for the comparisons that we need to do to navigate the tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time complexity of traversing the BSTs in a TST<a name=\"BST_complexity\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, each node in a TST also acts like a Binary Search Tree for the characters of the keys. So, when we're at a node and we want to move to the child that corresponds to the next character in our key, we need to traverse this BST. The cost of this traversal depends on how well balanced the TST (all the BSTs) is.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Balanced BSTs <a name=\"Balanced_BSTs\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In a perfectly balanced BST, the number of nodes doubles with each additional level of the tree, so the height of the tree (and therefore the maximum number of nodes that we need to examine in a search operation) is logarithmic in the number of keys N. Therefore, the cost the search cost in a BST is O(${\\log N}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the total cost of a search operation in a TST is the sum of the cost of traversing the trie structure an of traversing the BSTs: O(L + ${\\log N}$ ).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unbalanced BSTs <a name=\"Unbalanced_BSTs\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the keys are not randomly inserted, the BSTs in our TST would be unbalanced. For instance, in the case where the keys are inserted in sorted order the TST would degenerate into a linked list and the search cost would become linear in the number of keys, N, time complexity: O(N).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the time complexity of a search in a TST in that case would be O(L + N).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Base and Worst Case <a name=\"Base_and_Worst_Case\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion we can say that we have a best case and worst case scenario when considering the algorithm's time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Case: The best case occurs when the TST is perfectly balanced, i.e., the keys are evenly distributed so that each left and right subtree contains roughly the same number of nodes. In this case, the time complexity is O(L), where L is the length of the key. This is because we only need to compare each character in the key once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Worst Case: The worst case occurs when the TST is unbalanced, i.e., all the keys are such that they always go to the left child or the right child, making the TST resemble a linked list. In this case, the time complexity is O(L + N) as searching would require traversing through most or all of the keys (N), plus the comparisons equal to the length of the key (L). That's because we might have to traverse almost all the nodes in the tree to find or insert a key.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example we consider a TST with 8 keys, and we're searching for a key of length 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of traversing the trie structure would be O(3) = 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of traversing the balanced BSTs representations of each trie node is logarithmic in the number of keys, so it's O(${\\log 8}$) = 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the total cost of the search operation would O(3 + 3) = O(6).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the time complexity of traversing unabalanced TST would be O(8) = 8 . \\\n",
    "The total cost of the search of the TST would be O(3 + 8) = O(11) = 11\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time complexity of a search miss <a name=\"Search_miss\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of a search miss (searching for a key that does not exist) relies on the assumption that most of the nodes in the TST behave like random BSTs ([Sedgewick and Wayne, 2011](#references)). This means that the average path length in these BSTs is ln R, where R is the number of different character values. Therefore the total cost of a search miss is: $$ \\log_R N = \\frac{\\ln N}{\\ln R} \\cdot \\ln R = \\ln N $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time complexity of all_strings() <a name=\"all_strings\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "**all_strings()** cost: For retrieving all strings from a TST we would need to visit every node to retrieve all the keys. Therefore the time complexity for this operation would be O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in the TST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we previously defined N as the number of keys in the tree, this is not necessarily the same as the number of nodes. Especially if we have a lot of keys with common prefixes. Each key in a TST is represented as a path from the root to a node, and each character in the key corresponds to a node along this path. Therefore, the total number of nodes in the TST can be much larger than the number of keys. So while the time complexity of retrieving all keys is technically O(N), in practice the number of nodes N can be much larger than the number of keys."

    "__init__ in Node class: This is the constructor for the Node class. It initializes a new node with the given character (char), left, middle, and right children (left, mid, right), and a value (val). The value is used to mark the end of a string in the TST.\n",

    "The search method retrieves the value associated with a given key. If the key is an empty string, it checks if the root node has a value (which would indicate that the empty string is a valid string in the TST). Otherwise, it calls the _search helper function to search for the key in the TST.\n",

    "the repr method recursively traverses the TST and for each node, it first traverses the left subtree, then prints the current node's character (indented by the current depth), and finally traverses the mid and right subtrees. This results in a vertical representation of the TST, where each level of depth is represented by an additional level of indentation."
